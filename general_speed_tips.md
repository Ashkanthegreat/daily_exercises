## These tips are for OSX/Mac

1. Line beginning/end in console, browser, everywhere: 
 
   control + a for beginning, control + e for end.

2. Open a new tab in browser OR in console:
  
   command + t
   
3. Close a tab in browser OR in console:

   command + w
   
4. Go one tab right/left in browser, console, most editors:

   command + shift + open bracket: [ to go left, command + shift + closing bracket: ] to go right.
   
5. To quit an open program on your Mac. Make sure the program name is in the top left corner. In other words 
   make sure you are focused on that program:
    
   command + q
   
6. Quickly open any application/program (or even a file, but the Finder is better for that)

   command + space, then type in the name of the program you want to start up
   
7. Switch between running programs on your Mac without needing to use that clunky menu bar:

   command + tab (you can also use the direction arrows while keeping command held down to go left/right)
