### Answers can be found in answers.md AFTER you try answering all of the questions yourself.

1. What are the 4 raw/basic data types in Ruby? And what is the close cousin of those data types (
   it's not technically a data type because it can't be broken down any more into different values of the
   same type.) For the purpose of this question, structures are not considered types. We want raw types.

2. What are the two main data structures Ruby uses to hold multiple values? Name three that aren't 
   included in Ruby. By included I mean build in to Ruby.

3. Do values always have to be raw data types, or can structures also be values?
 
4. What are three ways to hold/reference values so we can use them later (for this question, variable will 
   refer to all types of variables, so is only one way.)

5. Is a thing that holds values also a value? How can we know that something in Ruby can be assigned as a 
   value (AKA object)?

6. What can you do with a class in Ruby without using methods? Is there a practical application?

7. What can you do with a class in Ruby without using variables?

8. What is the difference between a local variable and an instance variable?

9. How could you "extend" the life of a local variable if you needed to use that value in another 
   method? Are you really extending the life of the variable, or are you simply transferring the value?
   
10. Is a local variable, on a line, without an assigned value, legal in Ruby? How about an instance variable with 
    no assigned value?
    
11. When you see this: `random_thing` on a line by itself (inside of a method let's say), what are 
    the only two things it could possibly be in legal Rubyland? How could you quickly determine which 
    one of those two things it is?
    
12. How do you call/invoke a method inside of a class (it's been defined inside the class, and you 
    want to execute it's code from inside the class)?

13. How do you call/invoke a method from outside the class it's defined in (modules are not "classes"
    for the purpose of this question)?
    
14. Why are plain old methods `def my_cool_method` called instance methods? What are class methods?
    
15. Do you have to instantiate a class in order to be able to call methods on it? How could you call a 
    method on a class that hasn't been instantiated? (Hint: self)
