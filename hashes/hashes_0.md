### Hashes: Key => Value pairs. A way to nest named values.

- Just like the Array class, the Hash class is built BUILT IN to Ruby. That means when you use 
  the proper convention (you tell Ruby in the right way), you can make, read, and change/mutate 
  hashes in order to keep track of your values.
