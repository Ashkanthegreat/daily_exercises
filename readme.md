### Daily exercise routine, AKA, do your push ups!!

Many cognitive scientists agree that we all have a "mental bucket" that drains throughout the day
for various reasons, including having to make decisions. The harder the decision, the more willpower 
we need to use (more drains out of the bucket). Thus, concentrating really hard on making an array of
arrays for example, will make it that much harder to now do something with that array of arrays. 
 
Kathy Sierra and Katrina Owen, among others, talk about how to combat this in programming by making 
certain tasks automatic, thus turning them into "background tasks". If you can make an array of arrays 
by heart, it will be much easier to then concentrate on pulling values out of that structure, or whatever 
else you are doing with it.

To turn something into a background task you need repetition. You need programming push ups.

### Step one - Make a routine

NOTE: If you are brand new to programming, you should perform th example exercises below.

#### Here is an example of a "get to know your computer" routine a beginner using a mac might want to use:

RULE: CANNOT USE THE TRACKPAD DURING THIS EXERCISE (or you have to cut your finger off)

1. Open your terminal/console using command+space.

2. Open a browser(chrome, safari, firefox, etc.) using command+space.

3. Focus on the terminal, then the browser, using command+tab.

4. Quit the browser using command+q (make sure you are focused on it first).

5. Reopen the browser.

6. Focus on, then Quit the terminal using command+q.

7. Reopen the terminal and use command+t to open another tab in it.

8. Open another tab in the browser using the same command (command+t).

9. Open multiple tabs in both the terminal and browser, then close them one at a time using command+w.

10. Play around.

#### Now an example of a basic Ruby routine

USING THE CONSOLE (pry, irb, etc.):

1. Make an array (don't assign it) with five integers in it (1-5 is fine, no need to get fancy).

2. Try to now use that array (hint: you can't).

3. Attach that same array to a local variable called a.

4. Get the first number in the array (1 if you did 1-5)

5. Get the second number. Continue until you get all of the numbers, one at a time (this is repetition).

6. Get the first and second numbers in the array. They should be in array form (hint: use range). Output 
   will be: `[1, 2]` (assuming you used 1-5).

7. Repeat for second and third, third and fourth, etc. until you get to the end.

8. Get the last two numbers in the array, but with the last one first: `[5, 4]` (You may need to build the 
   array manually).

9. Add to the array using both push, <<, and unshift. Delete from the array using pop and shift. Assign 
   action to a variable to see what happens. (i.e. z = a.shift, y = a.pop). Note what happens to the array.

10. Ask the array for the index value of the third number. Repeat several times with different numbers.

11. to whatever: Add on more advanced things like iteration, deleting, deleting more than one number at
   a time, reverse it, use the reverse to get the last and second to last numbers if you didn't use
   that method above, etc.

REPEAT THIS PROCESS WITH AN ARRAY OF STRINGS, THEN SYMBOLS, THEN NILS, THEN MIX DATA TYPES

ALTERNATE DAYS MAKE A FILE AND USE YOUR TEXT EDITOR TO DO THIS SAME THING, RUNNING THE FILE EACH TIME TO
SEE THE RESULTS (hint: you may need to use puts, p, or print to get the output to look the way you want 
it to. Try them all).
